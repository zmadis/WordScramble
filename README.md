WordScramble
============
Overview of the Project

The purpose of this game app is to relieve stress, be entertaining, improve vocabulary and spelling skills, and provide a challenge for the user.

Put your thinking skills to the test with this word game that builds your vocabulary and spelling skills. You are given a few letters and you must guess the word by filling in the remaining letters correctly. You have three tries to get the correct word. If you do not get the word correct you are given an error message. Words are randomly generated. The object of the game is to complete all the words correctly. 

Required Android Permissions – Why The App Needs Them

Permissions are put in place to provide the user with a certain level of transparency as to what an app will access and the user makes a choice to allow the app to access information on their device. 

For my application the only permission that may be required is Android Application Security to protect the app against piracy tampering and reverse engineering.

Required Web Services – Why The App Needs Them

My application does not require any web services for the application itself at this time.

Required Built-In Features or Devices

My application does not require any built-in features or devices for the application itself at this time.

Testing Procedures

I used the emulator through Eclipse to test the code for the Android project.

I got the word right and the next word appears with the “You’re right” message. (This may be confusing for the user).

This is the first attempt at the word and I got it wrong. After the third try it will give me a new word.

Known bugs, limitations, and problems

One of the known bugs is when you get the word correct and the next word displays this message still displays at the bottom of the screen, “You’re right!”

One of the limitations is that the game does not end unless you press quit and you do not receive your total score of correct words.

Set of features to be implemented or next steps

The resume button is one of the next steps. The user would be able to stop and start back at the same place they left off. It would also be nice to add sound when choosing a letter and getting the correct answer and a different sound when getting the wrong answer. Giving a score at the end of the game that totals the number of correct words.

Some other features I would like to add are to have various random words of various lengths (not a set length) with various categories for the words. The user would be able to choose different categories for the words. In addition, I would like to have various levels of words such as easy, medium, and hard so the user would be able to grow and be challenged. Once the game is more exciting I would like to have it as an Internet game to play with other people in guessing the word or playing against each other to see who gets the most words correct.
