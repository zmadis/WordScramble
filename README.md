============
1.  Overview of the Project

The purpose of this game app is to relieve stress, be entertaining, improve vocabulary and spelling skills, and provide a challenge for the user.

Put your thinking skills to the test with this word game that builds your vocabulary and spelling skills. You are given a few letters and you must guess the word by filling in the remaining letters correctly. You have three tries to get the correct word. If you do not get the word correct you are given an error message. Words are randomly generated. The object of the game is to complete all the words correctly. 

2.	Required Android Permissions – Why The App Needs Them

Permissions are put in place to provide the user with a certain level of transparency as to what an app will access and the user makes a choice to allow the app to access information on their device. 

For my application the only permission that may be required is Android Application Security to protect the app against piracy tampering and reverse engineering.

My application does not require any web services for the application itself at this time.
